# CodeT5 + kNN for Code Generation

This repository contains code for code generation on the [CoNaLa](https://conala-corpus.github.io/) dataset using CodeT5 augmented with a nearest neighbor language model component.

The code currently only supports experiments on CoNaLa, though I plan to add support for Concode later on.
